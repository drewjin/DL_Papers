尊敬的Amir Zadeh，

您好！我在阅读您的论文《Tensor Fusion Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis》时，对实验3中的模态消融实验设计产生了一些疑问，我特别希望了解更多关于实验设计的具体细节，尤其是关于单模态、双模态配置以及在去除全部模态输入情况下的处理方法。我的疑问具体如下：

1. **单模态实验**：在您的研究中，是如何具体实施单模态实验的？比如，当仅考虑文本模态时，其他模态（音频和视频）的输入是如何被处理的？是否直接将它们置零，或是采用某种形式的填充策略？我对此处有着较为大的疑问，因为若是纯正的单模态信息，没有进行Fusion，那么其效果又是如何超过其他较为经典的Sentiment Analysis模型的呢？

2. **双模态组合**：在双模态实验中，您是如何选择组合模态对的？此外，对于每一对模态，另一未被选中的模态是如何处理的？以及为何没有对双模态中的三种组合都进行相应的讨论？

3. **去除所有模态输入**：去除三模态融合的张量后，是保留了其他三种双模态对的组合并进行了拼接抑或是其他处理吗？

这些问题对于我深入理解TFN模型的工作机制及其在实践中如何应用至关重要。我非常期待能够获得您的亲自解答，以便更加精确地复现和扩展您的研究成果。您的指导对我而言将是极其宝贵的资源。

感谢您在多模态研究领域的杰出贡献，以及对学术交流的持续支持。期待您的回复。

此致
敬礼！

Dear Dr. Amir Zadeh,

Greetings! As I delved into your esteemed paper, "Tensor Fusion Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis," I encountered inquiries specifically pertaining to Experiment 3 and its design for modal ablation studies. I am keen to understand the finer aspects of this experiment, particularly regarding single-modality, dual-modality configurations, and scenarios involving the omission of all modal inputs. My queries are outlined as follows:

1. **Uni-Modal**: Could you elaborate on how these were conducted? For instance, when focusing solely on the text modality, how were the audio and visual inputs managed? Were they set to zero or subjected to a particular padding strategy? I am particularly intrigued by the implications of pure single-modality inputs without fusion and how their performance could potentially surpass those of more traditional sentiment analysis models.

2. **Bi-Modal**: What guided your selection of modality pairs in the dual-modality experiments? Furthermore, how was the unselected third modality handled for each pair, and why wasn't an exhaustive discussion provided for all three possible combinations?

3. **no Tri-Modal**: In scenarios where the tri-modal fused tensor was not utilized, were the remaining dual-modality combinations concatenated or processed differently?

These questions are central to my comprehensive understanding of the TFN model's workings and its practical applications. Your personal insights would be invaluable for accurately replicating and expanding upon your research findings. Your guidance in this journey is of utmost significance to me.

I commend your remarkable contributions to the realm of multimodal research and your ongoing commitment to fostering academic discourse. I eagerly await your response.

Yours sincerely,
